# git-swoop üê¶

a quick little cli util to *swoop* to another branch, pull down the latest from remote, and then return to where you started

## What it does

I found myself frequently needing to jump to our develop branch and work and then return to my working branch so I could easily merge updates.  This just makes my life a bit easier, and hopefully yours too!

## Install

`git-swoop` can be installed by running

```bash
go install github.com/ammuench/git-swoop@latest
```

It should then be available in your terminal as `git-swoop`, if you cannot find it, you may need to configure your `GOBIN` or `GOPATH`.  [You can read the docs to configure that here](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install)

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run `make build` and `make install` to install it from source.  `git-swoop` was built with `go1.23.5`, but may work with older versions

## Commands

### `git-swoop <target-branch-name>`

Tries to check out your target branch, pull latest from remote, and return you to your original branch.

Will try to return you to your original branch if it encounters an error.

Will always log which branch you are on when it exits

### `git-swoop --help # aliases -h, -help`

Prints out a list of all flags and commands

### `git-swoop --version # aliases -v, -version`

Prints out version and license info

## License

`git-swoop` is published under a [GPL V3.0 License that can be found here](https://github.com/ammuench/git-swoop/LICENSE.md)
